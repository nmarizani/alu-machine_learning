Linear Algebra

0. Slice Me Up
Slices a given array to extract specific sections:
First two elements.
Last five elements.
Elements from the 2nd to the 6th position.
1. Trim Me Down
Extracts:
The 3rd and 4th columns of a given 2D matrix.
Uses only one for loop.
2. Size Me Please
Calculates the shape of a matrix as a list of integers.
Recursively determines the shape of nested lists.
3. Flip Me Over
Returns the transpose of a 2D matrix.
Swaps rows with columns.
4. Line Up
Performs element-wise addition of two arrays.
Returns None if the arrays are not the same shape.
5. Across The Planes
Adds two 2D matrices element-wise.
Returns a new matrix if shapes match, else None.
6. Howdy Partner
Concatenates two arrays into a new list.
Works for arrays of any size.
7. Gettin’ Cozy
Concatenates two 2D matrices along a specified axis (rows or columns).
Returns None if the shapes are incompatible.
8. Ridin’ Bareback
Performs matrix multiplication of two 2D matrices.
Returns a new matrix or None if the matrices are incompatible.
9. Let the Butcher Slice It
Extracts:
The middle two rows of a matrix.
The middle two columns of a matrix.
The bottom-right 3x3 sub-matrix.
10. I’ll Use My Scale
Returns the shape of a numpy.ndarray as a tuple of integers.
11. The Western Exchange
Returns the transpose of a numpy.ndarray.
Works for arrays of any dimension.
12. Bracin’ the Elements
Performs element-wise operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division) on two numpy.ndarray inputs.
Returns a tuple of results.
13. Cats Got Your Tongue
Concatenates two numpy.ndarray matrices along a specific axis.
Returns a new matrix or None for incompatible shapes.
14. Saddle Up
Performs matrix multiplication using numpy.matmul.
Returns a new numpy.ndarray.
100. Slice Like a Ninja
Slices a numpy.ndarray along specific axes defined by a dictionary.
Returns a new array after applying the slices.
101. The Whole Barn
Recursively adds two matrices of arbitrary dimensions.
Returns a new matrix if shapes match, else None.
102. Squashed Like Sardines
Recursively concatenates two matrices of arbitrary dimensions along a specific axis.
Returns None if shapes are incompatible along the axis.
