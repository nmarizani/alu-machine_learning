Data Visualization with Matplotlib and NumPy

This project showcases several data visualizations using Python, focusing on techniques such as line graphs, scatter plots, histograms, stacked bar graphs, and 3D visualizations.

Visualizations
Line Graph: Plotted y=x^3 as a solid red line.

Scatter Plot: Visualized mountain elevations with a gradient color scale.

Histogram: Displayed a histogram of student grades for "Project A."

Exponential Decay: Graphed the decay of Carbon-14 and Ra-226, with comparisons.

PCA Visualization: Used Principal Component Analysis to visualize the Iris dataset in 3D.

Stacked Bar Graph: Represented the number of fruits owned by individuals.

Requirements

Python 3
Libraries: numpy, matplotlib, scikit-learn (for PCA)
